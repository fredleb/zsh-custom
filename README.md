# zsh-custom

## Usage
Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/fredleb/zsh-custom.git ~/.zsh-custom
```
    
The scripts are not smart so you'd better install it in ~/.zsh-custom

then:
```
cd ~/.zsh-custom
./install.sh
```

Then you can immediatly start with:
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

One liner:
```
git clone https://github.com/fredleb/zsh-custom.git ~/.zsh-custom && cd ~/.zsh-custom && ./install.sh && source ~/.zshrc && cd
```
